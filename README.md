# hfst-example

This repository contains precompiled hfstol binaries for some languages we currently work with, and also examples of how to use hfst-python for analysis and generation. This is more of a testing area than a real place to look for anything, but I wanted to have an easy way to distribute the binaries for my colleagues without everyone having to install the whole Giellatekno infrastructure on their computers. For more concrete information, please see [HFST Python API documentation](https://hfst.github.io/python/3.12.2/index.html).

I'm also myself just trying to understand how hfst-python works (or Python generally, I haven't worked with that language very much anyway), so there is surely lots of place for improvement everywhere.

One important information is to store somewhere against which SVN revision the binaries are compiled, and I'm still thinking how this should be done. There surely are well established ways to do this anyway already.

I've also worked lately with [pympi](https://github.com/dopefishh/pympi) Python library, which allows easy and fast manipulation of ELAN files. I would assume that many use cases for these tools will somehow combine into more complex tasks, but how to structure those is currently unclear to me.
